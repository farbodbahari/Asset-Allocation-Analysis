Performed Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis to quantify the robustness of varying portfolio asset allocations during accumulation and consumption phase, Coded in Python
* what happens if during the accumulation phase (young, contributing to account) the allocation is 55 stocks / 30 bonds (you decide how to break it down, and always put 5% in real estate) or 85 stocks / 10 bonds? This is a sensitivity analysis on asset allocation
* what happens if the person increases the contributions while young by 10,000 and the withdrawals when old by 20,000? this is a sensitivity analysis on cash flows
* what happens if you use the 2015 expected returns on the base case? This is a sensitivity analysis on expected returns
